/*
im gonna use the pokeapi.co rest api to GET me some data to display and have some fancy information about pokemon for users to veiw

i should remember to cache results. if i have fetched once i should use it to its full extent before fetching again.
as patryk showed base info was easy to fetch but the image needed an additional request

todo:
make an utility fetch function?
get some poke info
display some pokeinfo
