            <h1>Welcome to my MATHtml!</h1>
            <p>
                Welcome to work in progress math adventure. I will explore the concept of mostly points in spaces such as 2D and 3D. From vector directions to quaternion rotations (why? cause i love myself :3). The magic of manipulating such data to make visually pleasing effects. And as a bonus HTML/CSS & JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
                We start of with a brief overview of what this site will offer. and that is my journey of understanding concept such as vector calculation on 2d and 3d spaces
                to the rotation of quaternions. ill also use this page to introduce myself. who am i and why do i do this. my nav bar should include links to the pages with main topics and an about me more in-depth and how to contact me. mostly this site will be used to explore my journey in math and its function in making effects in 3d 2d and in applications such as godot blender html/css/js to make mechanics such as aiming and algorithms or map generator such as cellular automata or fancy effects and animations.
                i will loosely discuss my thought process and how i approach and handle execution of creating an assortment of effects. its all having an idea and how to reach it. my methods will by no means be efficient or correct but the result shall be satisfactory.
                my mantra is results before efficiency. with quantity i will get quality
